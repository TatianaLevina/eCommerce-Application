                Hi, my name is Dmitry, and I am a FullStack developer‚ú®. (My main programming languages are TypeScript,
                C#). I am interested in both front-endüñ• and back-endüíΩ development. I like to learn new things.
                Experience with TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Scss, Vue.js, React, ASP.NET, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Delphi, Lisp.
                Some experience in developing microservicesüî¨.

                I&#39;m certain that effective communication is paramount. Regular meetings, code reviews, and shared
                documentation that everyone is on the same page and working towards a common goal. It&#39;s why,
                together with the team, we adhere to these beliefs and try to constantly be in touch and resolve issues
                in a timely manner.

                I am currently pursuing my second university degree, this time in Computer Science, with a
                specialization in JavaScript and TypeScript.

                Rapidly acquiring essential IT skills, I am proficient in coding, problem-solving, and adapting to new
                technologies and frameworks. With a strong dedication to personal and professional development, I
                actively seek out opportunities to expand my knowledge and explore new horizons. Open to new job
                opportunities, I am always eager to take on fresh challenges and collaborate on exciting projects.

                United by a common goal, the team and I found a common language and tools for organizing joint work in a
                short time, which was reflected in the development of our project.

                Hey, my name is Tatiana. Currently, I am wearing a front-end developer hat, but also used to do system
                and business analyst work. I prefer to build fundamental understanding on how things really work and
                what concepts are lying under the hood. This approach allows me to make big leaps in mastering new
                frameworks or tools. During this project, I received a good experience with TypeScript, React and antd
                (library of design components) and would like to continue developing my skills with them.

                One of the biggest challenges was to organize effective team work especially when overlapping things
                should be implemented. Here are the keys I found for myself:
                <ul>
                  <li> Do not try to eat the complex task with one bite: split it into small portions.</li>
                  <li>Make Pull Requests small and focused.</li>
                  <li>
                    Supply comprehensive information on how things should be tested if automatic tests are absent.
                  </li>
                  <li>Keep the release branch always stable.</li>
                  <li>If you start to implement a new feature or fix a bug, always make your teammates know that</li>
                </ul>
                They sound familiar, aren&#39;t they?
